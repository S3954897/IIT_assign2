								<h2>What does it do?</h2>
									<p>Blockchain technologies are a unique way of acquiring, storing and sharing information via a Ledger on a public or private network where all users have access to verify and view data using encryption. The concept begun in 1991 but was popularised in 2008 by an entity by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, who released a white paper concept using Blockchain technologies for currency, starting Cryptocurrency, specifically, Bitcoin.  </p>
									<p>Records of a transaction are recorded as Blocks of data that can show information of who, what where or why of any asset or product you are wanting to track. As a Block can only hold a limited amount of data, new Blocks are created to create a chain. The Block is then assigned a unique set of numbers and letters, which can be up to 64 digits long called a cryptographic hash. This hash code is what organises the information to be added to the ledger in Blocks, linking the Block with the previous Block and joining a new Block to the chain. These transactions once created, cannot be reversed because they are linked to the Blocks before them in a chronological order. This information sits on a distributed database that is visible to all users and no single user has control over the information, however, every user can verify records of any transaction. The concept of peer-to-peer transparency and the irreversible chain is what makes Blockchain technology a secure way of storing transactions in an anonymous way. Blockchain technology has also been suggested to store other sensitive data such as:  </p>
									<ul>
										<li>Medical Records</li>
										<li>Property Ownership and sale information</li>
										<li>Electoral Enrolment and Voting information</li>
										<li>Supply Chain</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Blockchain technology undoubtedly holds value for use beyond the cryptocurrency space and will one day potentially be the choice for banking institutions and manufacturers alike. The ability of providing real time supply chain transparency in a Business-to-Business setting would increase business confidence and productivity levels, simultaneously driving costs down. Reducing errors in communication or transfer data would allow for more time for businesses to focus on customer satisfactions and consumer confidence. This would be especially true in a Post Covid world where convenience and availability has become paramount.  </p>
									<p>Cryptocurrency and its popularity have risen over time and had its sharpest increase in the last 4 years with its prominence in online payment transactions. Since the infamous Pizza purchase using 10,000 Bitcoins in 2010 (this would translate to over $450 Million Dollars now) to now having over 18,000 different Cryptocurrencies available, Cryptocurrency has become the fodder and Achilles heel for punters chasing the next big money mover. Long forgotten as the currency of choice for shady Dark Web transactions on Silk Road, it is now become an E-Sport where anyone with an internet connection and a smart phone can become a Digital Stockbroker overnight. The main player remains Bitcoin, followed closely by Ethereum and Tether. Bitcoin’s popularity began to rise when more Tech companies began to see the value in trading with the Cryptocurrency space and started with small transactions within apps. This led to bigger companies adopting Cryptocurrency and so began the chain of other currencies being created by ambitious start-ups wanting to create momentum for their own brands and products.  </p>
								<h2>What is the likely Impact?</h2>
									<p>The rise of Cryptocurrency has also brought about the practice of Bitcoin mining. This is a process whereby specialised computers validate blockchain transactions and solve complex mathematical transactions and is awarded a coin in return. The process involves a network of computers which run constantly at high speeds and therefore require intensive cooling to perform their functions. The amount of electricity needed to run these operations is significant and has been proven to stress local power networks where these mining pools belong. In 2021, China banned Crypto mining in the country, forcing local operators to seek alternative locations to continue their operations. A large group migrated their operations to Kazakhstan. This put the entire country electricity grid at risk as the power consumption soared and citizens were put on rolling outages to keep up with demand. This highlighted the issue of resource draining and the EU moved to ban the practice to avoid this in the future. While the immediate electricity deficit was evident, the environmental impact will of the energy consumption is also being flagged as reckless usage for such little return of reward. This is especially egregious as nations around the world become increasingly concerned with Climate Change and the use of non-renewable power sources.    </p>
								<h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
									<p>While I personally have not invested in Cryptocurrency, most of my family live overseas in El Salvador who I personally support financially by way of money transfers from established agencies such as Western Union. El Salvador is an emerging country, having been through 21 years of civil war and only recently electing an independent government who is trying to bring the country in line with the first world by creating a Crypto friendly environment. In September of 2021, Bitcoin was made legal tender in El Salvador as all citizens with the government issuing a digital “Chivo Wallet” containing $30 for all citizens signing up to the scheme. From its inception, people were logging on only to notice their identities had been stolen, along with their promised sign-up bonus. The majority of citizens lost faith once they realised their internet connections were too weak to support the internet infrastructure to make fast transactions needed to make the scheme viable. When I first heard about this rollout, I was happy to speak to my relatives about it and the possible make the change from our current money transfer arrangement to an instant exchange with no fees, but quickly found the process stressful when my relatives could not find an ATM to withdraw the funds. By the time they had found someone who would trade with Bitcoin, their value had dropped considerably from the time it was sent. Whilst in theory the idea of circumventing traditional banking practices in emerging economies sounds like utopia, the reality is the crypto economy is too mercurial and leave the people it intends to help, in an even more vulnerable position by people who don’t even live in their economy on daily basis.  </p>
